This is a public container where I put some sample codes as reference.


The project_adhoc folder contains small, one-off codes which are not connected to each other.


The project_webapp is a reduced version of my Django webapp project which is suspended at the moment.
The goal of this was to create a webapp to support energy related data collection and reporting for internal and external use.
This demo contains an app called 'energia', which has its admin and model features (mostly) completed.
The other basic features like forms, templates and views are not implemented.
The project_webapp app has some hidden utility functions as samples and because of dependencies. One of them writes data into the database after verifying and formatting the input.
